# Summary
Ok So the DV Access Point Dongle, this is a device that was released several years ago and really has been supriassed by now. But still works and is still around (even if its not maintained). The device is an FSCK modem specificlly for acting as a D-Star Amature Radio Hotspot, so that you may get onto the refectors if you don't have D-Start repeaters near you or you just don't want to tie up the club's repeater so you can talk to someone in Japan. 


Anyway since I do have two of these and several D-Star radios ... I thought what the heck lets reverse engenner it and and use the provided technical Referance to idk do something else with it, or just make it supported in an open source manner (can't find source for the orginal DVTool). I appoligize if it is out there and I could't find it, After I have some tracktion and have my fun, or if I hit a brick wall I will reach out and see if I can't get ahold of some source.
